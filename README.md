# Dictionary App

The Dictionary App is a user-friendly web application that allows users to search for the meanings, phonetics, synonyms, and sources of English words. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app utilizes the [Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/) to provide comprehensive word definitions.

## Features

- **Search Functionality**: Users can input a word in the search bar and press 'ENTER' to fetch its details.
- **Word Details Display**: Shows the searched word, its phonetic transcription, and its meaning.
- **Synonyms Listing**: Provides a list of synonyms for the searched word, if available.
- **Source Links**: Includes links to the source of the word's definition.
- **Audio Pronunciation**: Users can click on a volume icon to hear the pronunciation of the word.
- **Clear Search Option**: A clear icon in the input field allows users to reset the search and enter a new word.

## How It Works

1. **Event Listeners**: The app listens for keyup events on the search input. When the 'Enter' key is pressed, it triggers the `fetchApi` function to fetch the word's details.
2. **Fetching Data**: The `fetchApi` function sends a request to the Dictionary API with the searched word and processes the response to display the word's details, including its meaning, phonetics, synonyms, and source.
3. **Dynamic UI Update**: The app dynamically updates the UI with the fetched word details. It handles cases where the word is not found by displaying an appropriate message.
4. **Audio Playback**: The app supports audio playback of the word's pronunciation. Clicking the volume icon plays the word's pronunciation.
5. **Clear Function**: The clear icon in the search input field allows users to easily clear the current search and enter a new word.

## Code Structure

- **JavaScript**: The main JavaScript file (`index.js`) contains the logic for fetching word details, updating the UI, and handling user interactions.
- **CSS**: The CSS file (`style.css`) ensures a clean and user-friendly interface.
- **HTML**: The HTML file (`index.html`) structures the app, including the search input, word details, and other UI elements.
